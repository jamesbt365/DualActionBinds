# DualActionBinds

Adds support for bindings that have different actions on press and release.


# Usage

1. Click the 3 dots next to any bindable tablet property in Bindings tab.
2. Find `DualActionBinds` on the list.
3. Enter any valid combination of buttons that regular or multi-key bindings support seperated by a colon (:) then another valid combination of buttons.

A couple examples of valid sets of bindings include `Shift+A:Shift+B` and `Control+Shift+P:Control+Shift+E`.

# Notes

Due to the inflexibility of the OTD interface and virtual keyboard, some combinations of keys are impossible, this is present on regular multi-key bindings too.

To ensure your bindings are valid, first check if they work in regular multi-key bindings, if it works, you can copy it and use it in this plugin.
